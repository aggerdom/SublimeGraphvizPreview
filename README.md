# Purpose Of This Fork

This is a fork of the awesome GraphvizPreview pluggin for Sublime. After downloading the pluggin and trying it out on a graphviz snippet, I was having trouble getting it to build the pdf. I originally assumed that the issue was with the way that it was creating temporary files and that the problem was that they were getting cleaned up before they could be opened in my pdf viewer. After going through and reimplementing the logic for how it handled temporary files, I discovered that the problem was actually that I was trying to preview a snippet with syntax errors: embarrasing right?

Anyways I ended up changing the behavior so that rather than creating new temporary files each time the pluggin is called and cleaning them up after the file was closed it would create two persistant files in user's temporary directory and overwrite them each time the pluggin was called. This behavior did however turn out to be preferable in the situation that you're using a pdf viewer, such as SumatraPDF, that doesn't lock pdf files while you're viewing them. Since rather than opening a new tab each time the pluggin is called, it will just update the tab you're previewing the graph in.

If you're interested in trying it out, just download the files in this repo and follow the manual installation instructions found at the [original repo](https://github.com/munro/SublimeGraphvizPreview).
